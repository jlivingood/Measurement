# Preliminary Thoughts for M-Lab Community Call on 02 Feb 2024

## Opening Question
> Access to high speed Internet does not necessarily mean access to high quality Internet. But if not speed then what? How should we measure Internet quality?
> Over the past decade, network and Internet measurement experts have been reaching a consensus that throughput measurements, more commonly referred to as “speed” tests, are not the only suitable proxy for the quality of an user’s experience using the Internet and that other metrics such as unloaded and loaded latency, jitter, and packet loss should also be considered. Additionally, experts often discuss the need for measurements that account for the impact of local wi-fi networks, as well as metadata to differentiate between different types of access technologies such as fiber and DSL. 

## Questions Posed
> What datasets, tools and methodologies should be included?
> What organizations, consortiums and experts should be consulted?
> What conversations (e.g., newsletters, mailing lists etc.) should we be part of?
> If you are interested in helping shape this work, how are you interested in contributing? Through an advisory committee? Through a survey? A workshop? Other formats?
